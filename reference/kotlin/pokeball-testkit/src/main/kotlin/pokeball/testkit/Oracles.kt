/**
 * Executable forms of the kernel rules that the runtime is responsible for.
 * Each check reads only the trace and the simulated ground truth, so it can
 * judge any runtime implementation that emits the same trace events.
 *
 * Durable runs keep one identity space across restarts. A Transient restart
 * begins a new world (fresh state, reused call identities), so its trace is
 * split into epochs at each recovery and every epoch is checked against its
 * own ground truth.
