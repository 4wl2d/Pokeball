/**
 * Time as a call. A timer is a [Call] on [Timer.port], made with [after]; its
 * completion is `Done(Unit)` when the timer is due. Cancelled before it fires,
 * it completes `NotDone(NotApplied)` (the timer reports that it did not fire);
 * cancelled while still waiting to start, `NotDone(Cancelled)`. A timer never
 * completes before its due time unless cancelled: under the Durable profile an
 * open timer is re-armed after a restart, and if the restart comes after its
 * deadline (due time plus [MARGIN_MILLIS]) it completes `NotDone(NoAnswer)`.
 * Treat a completion as a wake-up and re-check conditions kept in state.
 * Every conforming runtime binds this port.
