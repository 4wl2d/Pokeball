 * The single terminal result of a call or of an external request.

 * The three cases answer the question a caller must act on: did the requested
 * work take effect at the destination?
 *
 * - [Done]: the destination processed the request and answered with [Done.value].
 *   The value may itself describe a business refusal that the destination recorded.
 * - [NotDone]: there is evidence that the request had no effect.
 * - [Unknown]: the request may or may not have taken effect. Only reconciliation
 *   (for example a status query) can tell.
