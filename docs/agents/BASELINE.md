# Baseline gate

> **Status:** derived noncanonical package. This file does not define the architecture. If the two conflict, the canonical specification prevails.

This is the only place within `docs/agents/` where the exact SHA-256 of the canonical Core is recorded. The hash is calculated over exact bytes without normalizing line endings, Unicode, or whitespace.

```yaml

packRevision: 1

```

## Verification

From the repository root:

```sh
shasum -a 256 spec/pokeball-architecture-core.md
wc -c spec/pokeball-architecture-core.md
```

For package content, from the target repository root:

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
import hashlib

root = Path('docs/agents')
h = hashlib.sha256()
for path in sorted(p for p in root.glob('*.md') if p.name != 'BASELINE.md'):
    h.update(path.name.encode('utf-8'))
    h.update(b'\0')
    h.update(path.read_bytes())
    h.update(b'\0')
print(h.hexdigest())
PY
```

The Core hash/byte count/version, package file count, and package digest must exactly match the machine-readable block. `validation.status` must be `criteria-passed`; delivery integrity is verified through the self-contained fields above.

The root `LICENSE` and `NOTICE.md` license the source repository and are not included in the package content digest. The portable package carries the scoped `LICENSING.md`; it is included in the exact digest, so `AP-GATE-10` requires this file to be retained without replacing the consuming project's software license. Additional equivalent attribution is permitted, but does not replace the file within the verified package.

## Gate states

| State | Condition | Agent action |
|---|---|---|
| `READY` | The path, exact Core hash/byte count/version, and package count/digest match, and `validation.status = criteria-passed`. | The contract and runbooks may be applied within their scope. |
| `STALE` | The specification exists, but at least one value does not match. | Do not use the package as the basis for a change or conformance claim; read the actual Core and synchronize the entire package. |
| `MISSING` | The Core or this file is absent. | Stop the Pokeball-specific change and request the canonical artifacts. |
| `UNVALIDATED` | Integrity matches, but `validation.status` is not `criteria-passed`. | Analysis is permitted; release and conformance claims are prohibited until validation. |

Do not update only the hash. A new hash is permitted only after verifying the semantic diff, traceability, runbooks, reference index, and package gates. An absent accepted project overlay does not make the package stale or block construction/local project decisions; it blocks only a decision or claim that actually depends on an unresolved shared policy.
