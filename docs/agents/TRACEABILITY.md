# Agent Rule Traceability

> **Status:** derived noncanonical package. It neither defines nor extends Pokeball Core. Verify [BASELINE.md](BASELINE.md); Core prevails.

Sole rule definitions are in [AGENT-CONTRACT.md](AGENT-CONTRACT.md). This matrix routes each rule to Core, applicability, its authoritative source, and validation. `A/P/R/C` are the four classes in Core §20.1.

## Matrix invariants

- The contract and this matrix contain the same 35-rule set.
- Every rule has one Core source and explicit class/trigger.
- Core §8.12 is routed only by `REFERENCE-INDEX`; its 12 rows add no package-defined runtime owner, component, field, mechanism, or trigger.
- Shared policy/mechanism/evidence may close many covered Balls once at its exact digest and scope.
- Policy can select only choices Core leaves open. Neither policy nor an exact `WaiverRecord` suppresses a trigger, weakens a law, authorizes a direct-control cycle, or makes a `MUST`/`MUST NOT` violation conforming.
- A Ball records only its authoritative semantics plus any local declaration, different explicit selection, or allowed delta; the enclosing accepted scope owns a shared policy reference once.
- A proven-absent trigger requires no artifact; a conformance review records the closed absence proof once.
- A change to Core source, rule meaning, trigger, policy schema, or gate requires synchronized package validation.
