/*
 * Pokeball Core 2 — abstract model of the call-obligation protocol.
 *
 * Scope: one caller Ball whose runtime commits decisions durably
 * (Durable profile), a lossy/duplicating network, and one destination.
 * The model abstracts away business state: a "call" is created by a
 * committed decision and must receive exactly one terminal outcome.
 *
 * What is checked (bounded, not a proof for all sizes):
 *   P1 NoSendBeforeCommit      no request leaves before its decision commits
 *   P2 OutcomeStable           a terminal outcome, once applied, never changes
 *   P3 NoFalseNotDone          NotDone for an effectful call implies the effect never happened
 *   P4 AtMostOnceNonIdempotent the runtime never sends a non-idempotent request twice
 *   P5 DoneIsReal              Done is reported only after the destination processed the request
 *   P6 AtomicAcceptance        the caller's committed state and its obligation ledger agree
 *   L1 EveryObligationCloses   under fairness, every awaited call eventually gets an outcome
 *
 * Each Mutant switches on one plausible runtime bug. For every mutant
 * the model contains a command that is expected to FIND a counterexample
 * (expect 1); for the correct runtime every property is expected to hold
 * (expect 0) within the stated bounds. `run.sh` checks those expectations.
